1.ASG scaling step scaling based on CW alarm https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CL0hkjhxoo
create asg backed by LB , in asg go to auto scaling and create scaling policy , dynamic scaling step scaling . create cloud watch alarm for scale in and scale out and select those alarms in scaling policies and in alarms select cloud watch metric ec2- asg cpu utilization. this metric is created by default no additional setting


2.AWS Prod Example Abhishek day 7 aws https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZPTL_kNvXc
VPC: Creates a VPC with a customizable CIDR block.
Subnets:
2 public subnets in us-east-1a and us-east-1b, with public IP assignment enabled.
2 private subnets in us-east-1a and us-east-1b.
Internet Gateway: Creates an Internet Gateway (IGW) and attaches it to the VPC.
Route Tables:
Public Route Table: Routes traffic destined for the internet (0.0.0.0/0) to the Internet Gateway.
Private Route Table: Routes traffic destined for the internet (0.0.0.0/0) to the NAT Gateways.
NAT Gateways: Creates two NAT Gateways, each in a public subnet in separate AZs (us-east-1a and us-east-1b), allowing instances in private subnets to access the internet.
Elastic IPs: Allocates two Elastic IPs for the NAT Gateways.
To deploy this template:
Save the YAML to a file (e.g., vpc-template.yaml).
Go to the AWS CloudFormation Console and create a new stack, using this YAML file.
Monitor the stack creation process.
This template sets up a VPC with a typical architecture for a highly available environment across two AZs with private and public subnets, route tables, and NAT Gateways for internet access in private.
also create 2 ec2 servers behind an ASG in private subnets, setup a bastion host and ssh to ec2 servers in private subnet using bastion host and then setup application using same. then setup a alb with the 2 ec2 server intstances in (private subnets using alb tg .

What is a 2-Tier and 3-Tier Web Application?
2-Tier Architecture
In a 2-tier architecture, the application consists of two layers:

Client Layer (Frontend): The user-facing interface, such as a web browser or mobile app.
Data Layer (Backend): Handles business logic, database operations, and data storage.
Example: A simple web application where the frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) directly communicates with the backend database.

3-Tier Architecture
In a 3-tier architecture, the application is divided into three layers:

Presentation Layer (Frontend): User interface.
Application Layer (Middleware): Contains the business logic and communicates between the frontend and backend.
Data Layer (Database): Stores and manages data.
Example: A modern web application where a web server (e.g., Node.js) handles requests from the frontend and interacts with a database (e.g., MySQL).

How to Design 2-Tier and 3-Tier Applications in AWS
2-Tier Architecture in AWS
A 2-tier web application in AWS typically consists of:

Frontend:

Hosted on Amazon S3 with Static Website Hosting for static content.
Can be delivered via Amazon CloudFront for global content distribution and caching.
Backend:

Use Amazon RDS or DynamoDB for the database.
Optionally, deploy an API or business logic layer using AWS Lambda (serverless) or an EC2 instance.
Architecture Components:

Amazon S3: Host static frontend files.
Amazon CloudFront: CDN for faster content delivery.
Amazon RDS/DynamoDB: Database.
3-Tier Architecture in AWS
A 3-tier web application in AWS involves:

Presentation Layer:

Hosted on Amazon S3 (static content) or Amazon EC2 (dynamic content).
Use CloudFront for caching and distribution.
Application Layer:

Use Amazon ECS (containerized apps), AWS Lambda, or EC2 instances to run the business logic.
Load Balancers (ALB/ELB) distribute traffic to the application servers.
Data Layer:

Use Amazon RDS, DynamoDB, or Aurora for storing data.
Consider Multi-AZ deployments for high availability.
Architecture Components:

Amazon S3 / EC2: Frontend hosting.
Amazon ECS / AWS Lambda / EC2: Middleware for the application layer.
Application Load Balancer (ALB): Distribute traffic across instances.
Amazon RDS/DynamoDB: Backend database.
CloudFront: CDN for static/dynamic content.
Visual Representation
2-Tier Architecture
rust
Copy code
User -> CloudFront -> S3 (Static Website) -> RDS/DynamoDB
3-Tier Architecture
rust
Copy code
User -> CloudFront -> S3/EC2 (Frontend) -> ALB -> ECS/Lambda/EC2 (Middleware) -> RDS/DynamoDB (Backend)
Best Practices
High Availability:
Use Multi-AZ and Auto Scaling for EC2 or ECS.
Enable read replicas for databases.
Security:
Use Security Groups and Network ACLs.
Enable encryption (e.g., HTTPS, SSL, database encryption).
Use AWS WAF and Shield for DDoS protection.
Monitoring:
Use Amazon CloudWatch for logs and performance monitoring.
Use AWS X-Ray for application tracing.
AWS offers the scalability, reliability, and flexibility to design both 2-tier and 3-tier architectures based on your applicationâ€™s needs.



The five pillars of AWS Well-Architected Framework guide you in building secure, resilient, efficient, and cost-effective applications. Below are the pillars along with AWS services that can help achieve these standards:

1. Operational Excellence
Focuses on running and monitoring systems effectively and continuously improving processes and procedures.

AWS Services:
AWS CloudFormation: Automate infrastructure as code to deploy and manage resources.
AWS CloudWatch: Monitor resources and application performance with alarms and dashboards.
AWS Systems Manager: Automate operational tasks, manage instances, and run commands.
AWS Config: Track configuration changes and compliance in your AWS environment.
AWS X-Ray: Analyze and debug distributed applications.

2. Security
Protect systems and data through risk assessment, access control, and data encryption.

AWS Services:
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM): Manage permissions and access to resources.
AWS KMS (Key Management Service): Manage and encrypt sensitive data with encryption keys.
AWS CloudTrail: Log and monitor API calls for auditing.
AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall): Protect applications from common web exploits.
Amazon GuardDuty: Threat detection and continuous monitoring.
AWS Secrets Manager: Store and manage access credentials securely.
AWS Certificate Manager: Provision and manage SSL/TLS certificates.

3. Reliability
Ensure workloads recover from failures and meet the intended availability requirements.

AWS Services:
Amazon Route 53: Implement DNS routing and health checks.
AWS Auto Scaling: Automatically adjust resource capacity based on demand.
Amazon S3: Durable storage with cross-region replication.
Amazon RDS Multi-AZ: High availability for relational databases.
AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB): Distribute traffic across multiple resources.
AWS Backup: Automate data backup across AWS services.

4. Performance Efficiency
Use resources efficiently to meet system requirements and respond to changes in demand.

AWS Services:
AWS Lambda: Run code without provisioning servers (serverless computing).
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling: Scale compute resources dynamically.
Amazon CloudFront: Deliver content with low latency using a global CDN.
Amazon DynamoDB: High-performance, serverless NoSQL database.
AWS Global Accelerator: Improve global application performance by routing traffic to optimal endpoints.
AWS Compute Optimizer: Analyze usage patterns and recommend instance types.

5. Cost Optimization
Deliver business value at the lowest possible cost.

AWS Services:
AWS Cost Explorer: Visualize and manage costs and usage patterns.
AWS Budgets: Set up cost and usage alerts.
AWS Trusted Advisor: Identify cost-saving opportunities and optimize resource usage.
Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering: Optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective tier.
AWS Savings Plans: Reduce costs for compute usage.
Spot Instances: Use unused EC2 capacity at discounted rates.
